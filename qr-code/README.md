## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I went over a lot of the basics in this one. Primarily, I learned about the box model and then utilized flexbox. The CSS I'm most proud of in this one is learning how to center a div! (Until I have to google how to again...)

```css
.body {
  ...
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  ...
}
```

### Continued development

I definitely want to continue working with flexbox to understand all of its nuances, but I feel comfortable with it enough to move onto things like Grid.
